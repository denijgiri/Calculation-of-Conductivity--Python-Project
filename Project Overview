Hi, 
I am working as a student researach assistant in department of physics ( Terahertz group) in University of Marburg. I am working on the project to mearsure the conductivity of thin film cells
using Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy Measurement Data. I have been using python as a programming language to visualize and analyze the data taken from the experiment conducted in the lab.
I have uploaded the work and code so far I have done on the separate file in this repository. Basically, from the lab we got the data in the format Time(Pico second) and amplitude. Initially
I have present data in time domain format and in frequency domain by doing fourier transfom which is also known as frequency spectrum.  I have carried out the phase correction and  windowing 
of the time domain spectrum. The code used is shown in the different file with in this repository. With the help of that I have been able to calculate the the conductivity( Real and Imaginary
part) using Tinkham formula of thin film approximation. I have also calculated the standard deviation to measure the how data differs from the mean value.
